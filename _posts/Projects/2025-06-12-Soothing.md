## Abstract
### Background: 
Intentional suppression of specific memories disrupts hippocampal function, leading to amnesia of unrelated memories within a brief temporal window—a phenomenon termed the “amnesic shadow”. However, the mechanisms underlying shadow-induced forgetting (ShIF) and its modulation by conscious versus unconscious processing and emotional valence remain unclear. 

### Methods: 
This study examined variations in ShIF by manipulating image exposure conditions (conscious vs. unconscious) and emotional valence (positive vs. negative) across short- and long-term retention periods. A novel game-based approach was developed, where participants’ habitual motor responses were disrupted via reversed game controls, thereby inducing an amnesic shadow. Electroencephalography (EEG) was used to assess neural activity related to memory suppression. 

### Findings: 
Short-term ShIF was significant for consciously cued negative images, as evidenced by reduced memory performance immediately after the intervention. EEG analyses revealed increased inhibitory neural activity during the suppression of negative memories. Over time, the ShIF effect for consciously cued images diminished, whereas a delayed effect emerged for unconsciously cued images, suggesting distinct neural mechanisms underlying conscious versus unconscious forgetting. 

### Interpretation: 
These findings indicate that ShIF operates more effectively for negative and consciously accessed memories, highlighting the role of inhibitory control in memory suppression. Furthermore, the results underscore the potential of game-based interventions in facilitating intentional forgetting. Understanding ShIF mechanisms could contribute to therapeutic applications, particularly in conditions like posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
