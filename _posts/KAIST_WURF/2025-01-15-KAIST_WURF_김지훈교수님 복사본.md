'Deciphering the epigrnomic impacts of repetitive elements : How do retroviruses control our genes?'를 주제로 Danny Leung professor께서 강의하신 내용을 정리하였다.
{: .notice--info}

# Introduction
Hongkong university of science and technology

# 1. Introduction of epigenomics and the non-coding genome

## Waddington;s landscape
Stem cell's path is controled by the activation/repression of genes (topology of landscape)

## Epigenetic modifications
### 1. DNA methylation
- signitures of active enahcer, promoters, DNA methylation

3D genome organization in hierarchical structures
1. Chromosomal territories
2. Subnuclear compartments(leminar, non active / center, active)
3. Self-organized TAD
4. cis-regulatory structures : different enhancers/interactions make different gene expressions

### Advances in technologies
hiC, cut and run, chip seq, ... (-> single cell)

## Non-coding regions
1. cis-regulatory elements(~15%)
2. retrotransposons(41%)
repetitive sequences (LINEs, SINEs, endogenous retroviruses)

### Endogenous Retroviruses (ERVs)
Replicate in human genomes bu copyandpaste mechanisms
elements consists of LTF(long termincal repeats) and ciral genesintegrated retroviruses : evolutionary very successful
> can act as epigenetic regulators
> mutagenic effect, epigenetic repression, source of ncRNA, enhancer effect(serving as enhancers), alternative promoter

### viral mimicry by dysregulation of retrotransposons (tricking our cells)
- apporached cancer therapy : 세포가 바이러스에 감염된 것처럼 인식하게 만듦
- dysregulation of retrotrannsposons may induce similar response in chronic inflammatory diseases
2. Histone Modicfication : accetylation, metylation

> virus : one role => replication


# 2. ERVs may hace endogenous fuctions : Elucidating the effects of SARs-cov2 infection on the maternal fetal interface

cov-19 환자의 placentra(connects mather and fetus)를 포함한 maternal fetal interface에 focus하여,

## dysregulation of angiogenesis pathways
> LTR8B PSG gene cluster are downregulated됨을 발견하였다

한 PSG gene마다, 각 유전자을 억제하는 LTR8B enhancer 부위가 존재한다. LTR8B는 active histone mark를 유발

## Induced silence of LTR8B
=> PSG regulation을 확인함

# 3. HBV- HEpatocellulat carcinoma를 조절하는 retrovirus induced transcriptimic changes

## GPC3 SUPER ENHANCER ON, non-methylation of CpG region ; 둘 다 만족했을 때만 활성을 보임.

## retrotransposons의 changes가 HCC에서 특이적으로 보임.(loss of methylation을 유도하여, 특정 DNA의 overexpression을 보임)
High HERV-E expression은 환자의 survival과 양의 연관 (b.c. better response in immunotherapy)
crisperi knockdown of herve do subtle role in DNA expression

> 자동화 ?
